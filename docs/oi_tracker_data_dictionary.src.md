## Overview

Each data source and level of aggregation has a separate CSV, named using the following convention: *Data source* – *Geographic Level of Aggregation* – *Temporal Level of Aggregation*

Additionally, we have three files, **GeoIDs – State** and **GeoIDs – County** and **GeoIDs – City**, that provide information on geographic crosswalks and aggregation. These can be merged to any file sharing the same geographic level of aggregation using the geographic identifier. Additionally, **GeoIDs – County** indicates the commuting zone (CZ) and state that each county belongs to. The City-level data (listed under "Metro" on the tracker site) associates the largest cities in the United States with a representative county one-to-one (except in the case of New York City which includes the 5 boroughs).

Finally, we have gathered a collection of key state-level policy dates relevant for changes in other series trends and values. These are contained in the **Policy Milestones – State** file.

A description of the columns in each file follows.

Note that for every variable listed here, there is a corresponding variable with the prefix `break_` (for example, `break_engagement`). During the period in which schools are on summer or winter break, we record the outcomes in these `break_` variables instead of the usual variables. These numbers are not displayed on the [Economic Tracker](https://tracktherecovery.org) because they do not reliably measure differences in student learning across geography and income groups when many schools are on break.

To ensure privacy, the results for some counties are masked. Where possible, masked county levels values are replaced by commuting zone means, as indicated by the `imputed_from_cz` variable. The masking criteria are explained in further detail in our [data documentation](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker/blob/main/docs/oi_tracker_data_documentation.md#online-math-participation).
